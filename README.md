  development from Jetbrains.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Android‚Äôs
  modern toolkit for building native UI.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - A coroutine is a
  concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes
  asynchronously.
- [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
  version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) -
  Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [Stateflow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is
      a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
    - [Dagger-Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Dagger-Hilt is an official dependency injection library for Android, simplifying the process of managing dependencies and providing compile-time safety.
    - [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) - A flow is an asynchronous
      version of a Sequence, a type of collection whose values are lazily produced.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores
      UI-related data that isn"t destroyed on UI changes.
    - [Compose Destinations Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) - 
      Simplified and type-safe navigation for Compose.
    - [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) -

    - [Room Database](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) -
      Abstraction layer over SQLite, simplifying local data storage and access in Android apps..
- [AlarmManager](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager)
    - AlarmManager API allows scheduling and managing alarms to perform actions at specified times or intervals, even if the app is not running.
- [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and the JVM
- [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) - A modern JSON library for Kotlin and Java.
